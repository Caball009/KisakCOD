Learn about the Development of KisakCOD here: [https://lwss.github.io/Duty-Of-Kisak/](https://lwss.github.io/Duty-Of-Kisak/)

## Current Requirements
- Windows OS
- Visual Studio 2022
- CMake >= 3.16
- [DirectX SDK 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)
- Steam with a copy of [Call of Duty 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/7940/Call_of_Duty_4_Modern_Warfare_2007/)


## How to build
1) Install the above requirements and Clone repo
2) Open a terminal and run `scripts/mksln.bat` or `scripts/mksln_dedi.bat` for the dedicated server
3) Open .sln projects that are generated in `build/` and `build-dedi/` respectively ^^ 
4) Copy COD4 Game files to `bin/*` (Don't try to cherry-pick them, small files like localization.txt are needed)
5) Copy `deps/binklib/binkw32.dll` to `/bin`
6) Copy all files in `deps/msslib/dlls/*` to `/bin`
7) Copy `deps/steamsdk/steam_api.dll` to `/bin`
8) Run the game via Visual Studio play button or just the .exe

Keep in Mind: This is a ~20 year old game with some known exploits. We will try to fix these as we become aware of them.
However, there is a non-zero chance of some type of binary exploitation when playing online. Use a sandbox (Sandboxie?) for peace of mind. 
```

## Known Issues
(Use the **[issues](https://github.com/SwagSoftware/KisakCOD/issues)** section)

## Troubleshooting
- ***Can't Connect to Dedicated Server*** :
  -  Check `net_ip` and `net_port`, the server will increment the port if the preferred one isn't available but the client won't sweep upwards.
 - ***DLL Error upon launch*** :
   - You didn't copy over the necessary runtime DLL's
